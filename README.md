#### Railroader Mod
# T-cave's Stenzel Edit
#### carve-out by Leif_The_Head

This is the Stenzel Edit, isolated as standalone mod, from [T-cave's Machining and Manufacturing](https://github.com/T-cave/T-cave-s-Machining-and-Manufacturing).

Additionally the bolt-on outputs are now part of a formulaic industry, meaning they will only be produced as long as there is raw material in storage.

## Installation
This is a [Railloader Mod](https://railroader.stelltis.ch/), and as such requires Railloader itself and follows the standard Railloader installation way.

### Requirements
- [Zamu's Strange Customs](https://railroader.stelltis.ch/mods/strange-customs)
- [AlinaNova's MapMod](https://railroader.alinanova.dev/) (progressions)
- [NickB's Standard Catalog of LoadIDs](https://sites.google.com/view/westerntrainzkgp/railroader-mods/the-standard-catalog-of-loadids) (loads)

### Conflicts
- T-cave's Machining and Manufacturing (duh)
- HJ's Stenzel MFG (increases throughput, just as this mod, but without additional track)
